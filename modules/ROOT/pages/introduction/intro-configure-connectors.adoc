Because a connector is a component in a Mule app, you should understand how to configure a Mule app before you try to configure a connector.

== Connector Configuration Requirements

Every connector has specific configuration requirements, which are described in the Reference Guide for that connector. Although connectors have different configuration requirements, most connector configurations require that you configure:

* An input source to start the app flow
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
* The authorization credentials needed to connect to the connector's data source, for example, to the Salesforce Marketing Cloud, Amazon S3, or SAP Concur APIs. Most connectors use Basic (username and password), OAuth, or OAuth2 authentication schemes.
* A connector operation to perform the desired action

=== Configure an Input Source

To configure an input source for a connector, select an input source associated with the connector you are configuring, or select HTTP Listener or Scheduler. Not all connectors have associated input sources.

For more information about input sources, see <<introduction/introduction-to-anypoint-connectors.adoc#input-sources, Input Sources>>.

To see if the connector you are working with as its own input sources, see the Reference Guide for that connector.

To configure authorization credentials for a connector, it is recommended that you create a <<global-element,global element>>, which lets you reuse the configuration for other connector instances. For some connectors, configuring a global element is mandatory.

=== Configure a Connector Operation
=======
* The authorization credentials needed to connect to the connector's data source, for example, to connect to the Salesforce Marketing Cloud, Amazon S3, or SAP Concur APIs
* A connector operation to perform the desired action

=== Connector Input Source

To configure an input source for a connector, select an input source associated with the connector you are configuring, or use the Anypoint Connector for HTTP (HTTP Connector) Listener operation or the Scheduler Endpoint. Not all connectors have associated input sources.

For more information, see:

* <<introduction/introduction-to-anypoint-connectors.adoc#input-sources, Input Sources>>
* <<http/http-connector.adoc#input-sources, HTTP Connector>>
* xref:mule-runtime::scheduler-concept.adoc[Scheduler Endpoint (Trigger)]

To see if the connector you are working with has its own input sources, see the Reference Guide for that connector.

=== Authorization credentials

Connectors that connect to external APIs use the Basic (Username and Password), OAuth, or OAuth2 authentication scheme.

To configure authorization credentials for a connector, it is recommended that you create a <<global-element,global element>>, which enables you to reuse the configuration for other connector instances. For some connectors, configuring a global element is mandatory.

=== Connector Operations

Connector operations are calls to external APIs or other connectivity-related actions that a connector can perform. You can use connector operations anywhere in a flow.

Each connector has different supported operations. To see the supported operation for a specific connector, see the Reference Guide for that connector.

== Best Practices for Configuring Connectors

The following best practices apply to configuring connectors:

* Use a global element to define configuration details that can be shared with other instances of the connector in the flow.
* Use a properties file to store configuration variables.
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
=======
* Test the connectivity of a connector before you deploy it.

* Configure a reconnection strategy to set the number of reconnection attempts to try after an initial failure.

[[global-element]]
=== Use a Global Element to Define Configuration Details

Global elements act as reusable objects. When you configure a global element for a connector, other instances of that connector in the flow can share that global element.

To use a global element, create one global element to configure your connection, configuration, or transport details for the connector. Reference the global element from other instances of the connector in the flow to ensure consistency across flow elements.

Besides the benefits of reusability and consistency, global elements also make connector maintenance easier. If you must change a connector's configuration, you can change the configuration once in the global element and it will apply to all connectors that reference the global element.

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
Most connectors support the use of a global element for authentication and other functions. For information about configuring a global element for a specific connector, see the User Guide for that connector.

[[properties-file]]
=== Use a Properties File

Instead of using static values for your connector configuration, you can create a `.yaml` file or `.properties` file to contain your properties and then reference them from the configuration.

Using a properties file improves the organization and maintainability of your applications.

For more information about using properties files, see xref:mule-runtime::mule-app-properties-to-configure.adoc[Configure Property Placeholders].


[[reconnection-strategy]]
=== Configure a Reconnection Strategy
=======
For examples of creating global elements, see:

* <link to the Studio configuration topic>
* <link to the Design Center configuration topic>.
* <link to the XML coniguration topic>

For information about configuring a global element for a specific connector, see the User Guide for that connector.

[[property-placeholders]]
=== Use a Property Placeholder for Property Values

Instead of using static values for a connector configuration, you can use http://ant.apache.org[Ant-style] property placeholders, as shown in this example for the *Access Key*, *Secret Key*, and *Region Endpoint* fields:

image::introduction/intro-property-placeholders-studio.png[Configuring Property Placeholders]

Using property placeholders improves the maintainability of your applications because they enable you to change configuration values in one place. If you don't use property placeholders and configuration parameter values change, you must search for changed parameters in the connector configuration screens or configuration XML.

To make the values for the placeholders available, create a `.yaml` file or `.properties` file to contain the values, and then reference the file from the connector configuration. For Studio, you do this by storing the file in `/src/main/resources`.

For more information about using property placeholders, see xref:mule-runtime::create-and-configure-your-properties-file.adoc[Configuring Property Placeholders].

[[test-connectivity]]
=== Test the Connectivity of the Connector

Both Studio and Flow Designer enable you to text the connection between a connector and its data source by clicking a button.

In Studio, once you configure all connection values, click *Test Connection* in the *Global Element Properties* screen, as shown in the following screenshot:




[[reconnection-strategy]]
=== Configure a Reconnection Strategy for the Connector
>>>>>>> Stashed changes

When a Mule app starts, a connectivity test runs on connectors that must connect to an external server. If the test fails, the default behavior is to log a warning message and continue with the deployment of the app, instead of blocking the deployment.

You can modify this behavior by setting the number of reconnection attempts to try after an initial failure and forcing the deployment to fail when all connection attempts fail.

To configure a reconnection strategy for a connector, use the *Advanced* sub-tab in the global element configuration *General* tab. The following screenshot shows a global element configuration for the HTTP Listener in Studio. The example configures a reconnection strategy that:

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
* Forces the deployment to fail if the connection fails and any configured reconnection attempts are exhausted.
* Limits the number of reconnection attempts to 5 at a frequency of every 4000 milliseconds (ms).

To see if a specific connector supports a reconnection strategy and to obtain information about reconnection strategy settings, see the Reference Guide for the connector.
